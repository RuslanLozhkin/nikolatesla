    <p>
Inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system. He is known as the supporter of the existence of the ether:
well known for numerous of his experiments, which aimed to show the existence of the ether as a special form of matter, amenable to use in the art. Name N. Tesla named unit of measurement of magnetic flux density (magnetic induction). Among the
many academic awards — medals E. Cresson, John. Scott, T. Edison.

        <p id="1882/2">
          <li><strong>1882</strong> - In 1882, Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle used in alternators and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field force to generate torque
            in rotating machines.</li>

        <p id="1887/2">
          <li><strong>1887</strong> - In April 1887, Tesla began investigating what would later be called X-rays using his own single terminal vacuum tubes (similar to his patent #514,170). This device differed from other early X-ray tubes in that it had
            no target electrode.</li>

          <li><strong>1888</strong> - At an AIEE meeting on May 16, 1888, Nikola Tesla delivered a lecture entitled A New System of Alternating Current Motors and Transformers, describing the equipment which allowed efficient generation and use of polyphase
            alternating currents.</li>

        <p id="1913">
          <li><strong>1913</strong> - Tesla's patents state that the device was intended for the use of fluids as motive agents, as distinguished from the application of the same for the propulsion or compression of fluids (though the device can be used for

Read about this famous researcher. His life was very hard and he had to prove his
ideas to others. He had many problems peculiar to modern scientists. But these
difficulties developed in him a firmness of character and steadfastness in his convictions.
